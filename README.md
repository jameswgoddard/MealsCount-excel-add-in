# MealsCount-excel-add-in

The end goal of this project is to provide an Excel add-in to make it easier for users to access [MealsCount data](https://github.com/opensandiego/mealscount-backend).

Most of the code in this repository was autogenerated by Visual Studio while following [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/quickstarts/excel-quickstart-jquery?tabs=visualstudio).

The application specific code mostly lives in Home.html, Home.js, and Home.css

The initial commit of this project pulls data from JSONPlaceholder's test endpoint and places it in cell A1. 

Next we'll need to better understand the user's Excel sheet and the MealsCount data format. 

I'm new to all of this and did all my testing natively in Visual Studio so another thing we'll need to figure out is how to deploy this add-in in the user's environment.

There appear to be several options: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/publish/publish#outlook-add-in-deployment
